# ButtButt

## Description

This game is like a good old platformer, but you can only use two actions. By passing through the "control changers", your 2 actions are replaced by 2 other actions.

You have to find the exit, by passing through those control changers.

You can download the game [here](https://non0w.itch.io/buttbutt)!

This was initially [my entry](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam122016/rate/116179) for the 2016-2017 Godot Game Jam. The theme was "two buttons".
